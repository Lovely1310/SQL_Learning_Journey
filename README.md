## 📌 Project Overview
A curated collection of professional SQL scripts developed to master the journey from basic queries to complex relational database management. This repository serves as a technical documentation of database design, integrity constraints, and high-performance querying techniques.

---
My goal is to build a strong foundation for a **Data Analyst / IT role** by practicing SQL in a structured and professional way.

## 🚀 What You Will Learn

- SQL Fundamentals (CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Filtering & Sorting Data
- Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Constraints & Relationships
- Transactions (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
- Real-world style tables & queries

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| MySQL | Writing and testing SQL queries |
| GitHub | Version control & portfolio |
| VS Code / Workbench | Code editor |


Each file focuses on one concept and contains:
- Clean SQL code  
- Real-life style examples  
- Comments for understanding

### Why this is the "Best & Professional" choice:
1.  **Learner's Roadmap:** The first chart shows that you have a structured path (Roadmap), which looks great to recruiters.
2.  **Schema Chart:** The ER Diagram shows you understand how tables link together.
3.  **Module Table:** It organizes all your files (`01_create...`, `joins.sql`, etc.) into clear categories.
4.  **No Automation Mention:** As requested, I removed everything about Zapier so the focus is 100% on your SQL skills.
5.  **Technical Focus:** It highlights high-level concepts like **ACID properties**, **Cascading**, and **Referential Integrity**.
